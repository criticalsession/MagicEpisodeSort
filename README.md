# Magic Episode Sort

### First of all, never download tv shows. That's bad, mkay?

But let's say you really, really wanted to download all 50 episodes that came out this week, and then you wanted to throw them onto your media library, PLEX/EMBY enabled NAS. What are you gonna do? Just chuck 'em on there all willy nilly??

**No!** *Of course not.*

You gotta create folders for the shows and then folders for the seasons and then move the video files and leave all the garbage behind. Ain't nobody got time for that.

This tiny software will solve the problem of cluttered hard drives all around the world. Throw the software into your favorite download folder, run it, and it'll sort everything all by itself.

You just need delete what's left behind yourself.

**If you wanna try this, don't run it on, like, your entire media library lmao Give it a try in a small folder with some sample downloads.**

### Most importantly though, I do not condone illegal downloading of tv shows.
